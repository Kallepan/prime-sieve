# Prime Number Generator

This project is a simple C++ program that generates all prime numbers up to a given limit using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

## Features

- Efficient prime number generation using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
- Measures and displays the time taken to generate the prime numbers.
- Option to print the generated prime numbers to the console.

## Usage

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, if you're using the GNU g++ compiler, you can compile the program with the following command:

2. Run the compiled program:

    ```bash
    g++ main.cc -o prime_generator
    ```

3. When prompted, enter the limit up to which you want to generate prime numbers.

4. The program will display the time taken to generate the prime numbers.

If you want to print the generated prime numbers to the console, uncomment the #define PRINT line at the top of main.cc before compiling the program.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler is required to compile and run the program. The program uses features from the C++11 standard, so a compiler with C++11 support is necessary.
